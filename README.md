## Face Recognition Application

This application uses a machine Learning API to determine wether the picture provided is a person's face and if so it will show the user where the face is in the picture.

To use this application:
1. you will have to find a image, I used google to do this
2. after copy the image address of the picture you want to use
3. paste it into the text box of application and click detect
4. See results!!

This application was developed with react, HTML/CSS. Currently working on the back-end so users can sign in and out with their email.
